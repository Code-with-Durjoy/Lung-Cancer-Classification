# Lung-Cancer-Classification
A deep learning project to classify lung cancer subtypes using histopathology images from the LungHist700 dataset. Three models — ViT, ResNet50, and EfficientNet — were compared after applying data augmentation and class balancing. EfficientNet achieved the highest accuracy (70–75%), proving more suitable for small medical image datasets.
